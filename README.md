# Raman-spectroscopy---data-analysis-in-Python-and-autonatic-export-to-txt-files
Python (jupyter notebook) script to perform data analysis of Raman spectrum with fitting Lorentz (or double Lorentzian) curve to chosen mode and automatic export to txt file. This example was made in order to annalyse carbon nanotubes single point, multiple acquisitions measurement data and also mapping measurement data.

New commit includes zunzun's idea of using genetic algorithm to improve the script by using selected by algorithm initial parameters instead of fixed ones.
