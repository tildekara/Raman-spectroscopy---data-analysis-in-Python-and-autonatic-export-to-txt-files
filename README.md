# Raman-spectroscopy---data-analysis-in-Python-and-autonatic-export-to-txt-files
Python (jupyter notebook) script to perform data analysis of Raman spectrum with fitting Lorentz curve to chosen mode and automatic export to txt file. This example was made in order to annalyse carbon nanotubes single point, multiple acquisitions measurement data.

Data files included work with Raman_mapping_measurement.ipynb
